# What is it?

**rangeela** is a little script to generate an image full of randomly coloured
squares and sets that image as your wallpaper. 

# Quick Start

Installation requires [python 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2/) obviously,
[`pygame`](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) for generating the image and 
[`feh`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Feh) for setting the that image as your wallpaper.

You can install all of them from your favorite package manager, can't you?

# Installation

`$ git clone https://github.com/anshulc95/rangeela.git ~/rangeela`
`cd | cp ~/rangeela/rangeela.py ~/rangeela.py`

and since I'm using [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/), I have the below line in my ~/.i3/config file.

```
python2 ~/rangeela.py
```

To know where *you* should put this, read this Arch Wiki for [autostarting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Autostarting) 
things in your DE/WM.
