# colorcubes

A scipt wriiten in Python 2.7.10 using the [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) library, that sets up randomly generated squares as your wallpaper on each startup, according to your screen resolution.

My inspiration was [this](https://github.com/zzggbb/colorblocks) beautifull script made by [Zane
Bradley](https://github.com/zzggbb).

Requirements:
```
feh
```
read more about it here at [Ach wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Feh).

Usage:
Clone the repo, and put the script in you **home** directory.
Just put this in your .xinitrc or your startup script according to your DE/WM.
Since I use [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/), I have the below line in my ~/.i3/config file.
```
python2 ~/rangeela.py
```
